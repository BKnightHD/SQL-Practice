# SQL Fundamentals - Datacamp Course Repository

This repository contains my coursework, notes, and projects from the Datacamp SQL Fundamentals track. The materials cover essential SQL concepts from basic queries to advanced database design principles.

## Course Overview

This repository is organized by course modules, progressing from foundational SQL syntax to advanced topics in PostgreSQL and database architecture.

## Modules

- Filtering Records
- Aggregate Functions
- Sorting and Grouping

### 3. Joining Data in SQL
Combining data from multiple tables:
- Introduction to Inner Joins
- Outer Joins, Cross Joins and Self Joins
- Set Theory for SQL Joins
- Subqueries

### 4. Data Manipulation in SQL
Working with data modification:
- We'll take the CASE
- Short and Simple Subqueries
- Correlated Queries, Nested Queries, and Common Table Expressions

### 5. PostgreSQL Summary Stats and Window Functions
