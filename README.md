# SQL Fundamentals - Datacamp Course Repository

This repository contains my coursework, notes, and projects from the Datacamp SQL Fundamentals track. The materials cover essential SQL concepts from basic queries to advanced database design principles.

## Course Overview

This repository is organized by course modules, progressing from foundational SQL syntax to advanced topics in PostgreSQL and database architecture.

## Modules

### 1. Introduction to SQL
Foundational SQL concepts including:
- SELECT statements and basic queries
- Filtering data with WHERE clauses
- Sorting and limiting results
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)

### 2. Intermediate SQL
Building on fundamentals with:
- CASE statements for conditional logic
- Subqueries and nested queries
- Data type conversions
- Advanced filtering techniques

### 3. Joining Data in SQL
Combining data from multiple tables:
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN
- CROSS JOIN
- Self joins and set operations

### 4. Data Manipulation in SQL
Working with data modification:
- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- CRUD operations
- Data integrity and constraints
- Transaction management

### 5. PostgreSQL Summary Stats and Window Functions
Advanced analytical queries:
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK)
- Aggregate window functions
- PARTITION BY and ORDER BY clauses
- Moving averages and cumulative sums

### 6. Functions for Manipulating Data in PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL-specific data manipulation:
- String functions
- Date and time functions
- Mathematical operations
- Type casting and conversion functions

### 7. Database Design
Principles of database architecture:
- Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- Entity-Relationship diagrams
- Primary and foreign keys
- Database schema design best practices
